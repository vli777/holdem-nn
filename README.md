Inspired by Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A Case Study on Chess
[arXiv:2402.04494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04494)

Using the latest transformer models, the team was able to approach the leading poker AI performance using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

This project uses generated data instead of actual game play data for training. The model architecture still needs to be updated. For now, it is a simple neural net with Linear - Relu - Linear layers.

Instructions

1. Install requirements
2. Generate or place game data .npy files in data/ (see generate_data.py encoding methods to view format)
3. Run train.py
4. Test out a sample hand by running main.py
